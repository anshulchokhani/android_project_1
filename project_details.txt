I love to write.I have a diary of my own.But I'm not sure how would people react to my writings and hence I dont share them 
with any one but still I wish I could know if someone had the same feelings.

Wish if there was a platform where you could share your writing and noone would need to know who wrote it! Is it sharing
the writing that matters?
